v0:
    Work through the errors.
    A lot of the stuff in Monster is in Protagonist.
    If you add a defense stat to Protagonist you don't need to attack in Monster

v1:
  Scratch that.
  The duplicates should use a superclass.
  This means that all stats need to apply to both.
  However, we do not need any dedicated methods other than getName

v2:
  We can use another level of subclasses to add more variety.
  We can use the scanner and readLine to get inputs and set the Character type.
  We also need to make sure that all the subclasses are appropriately named and extended.
  If we use variable multipliers to determine differences between characters, we only need constructors in the subclasses.
  This simplifies every thing while still keeping it interesting.
